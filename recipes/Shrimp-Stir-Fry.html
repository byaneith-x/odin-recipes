        <h2>Ingredients/Variations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>VEGETABLES</li>
            <li>PROTEIN</li>
            <li>Flavor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To make prep faster, check the produce area in your grocery store, many stores carry fresh chopped stir fry
            veggies.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the sauce first and set aside.</li>
            <li>Gently saute shrimp until they just turn pink. Theyâ€™ll cook a little bit more when combined with the
                sauce so be sure
                not to overcook them. Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir fry the veggies I chose broccoli and peppers but you can use whatever veggies you want.</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp and sauce and cook a few minutes until bubbly. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
